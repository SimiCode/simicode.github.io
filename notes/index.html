                        Stop pressuring yourself into making sense of everything. Sometimes you just have to accept that
                        you dont know the answer to what this, why that, where blabla..

                        As an intelligent human, you may seem like you are declaring yourself less powerful and less
                        wise, but thats it.

                        You will never have the dots fully connected. If you believe, of which I recommend that you
                        should, surrender to God, one with higher power and infinite ability.

                        You who believe in repentance think that God is always willing to start your relationship with
                        him afresh. That is not true. Your relationship with God never gets tainted regardless of your

                        that can be washed away is indeed not part of you.
